# playrandom-py

The initial concept was inspired by my grandmother, who faced challenges operating her TV due to her dementia. To alleviate her difficulties, I decided to set up a Raspberry Pi device that stored all her favorite shows. This way, she only needed to handle the task of turning the TV on and off.

Later on, we expanded the use of this setup to assist our son with Autism in managing the TV he used. Additionally, we integrated choices and functionalities from the repository found at https://github.com/Provo-City-School-District/pcsd-tvcontrol-pi. We modified the commands to utilize CEC controls for switching inputs on the TV.

Furthermore, we added a few buttons that allow him to select specific shows conveniently.
